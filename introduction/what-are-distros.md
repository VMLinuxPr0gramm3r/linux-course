Since GNU/Linux was an open source source project, there were many Distributions or distros of the Priject. Which were simply based on the Linux kernel and the GNU coreutils and had their own software like.
* Package Manager
* Desktop Enviroment / Window Manager

A package manager is a utility that allows you to install software, which are present in the repositories of the Distribution. This makes Linux much secure than Windows as you dont have go to the website of the Software and download an installer, which if downloading from third patry sites could also be Malware / Virus.
A Desktop Environment is a programme that can give you a GUI enviroment to Work on.
