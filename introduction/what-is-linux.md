# Indtroduction to Linux

What is Linux: Linux is the kernel of the GNU operating system made by Richard Stallman and publicly announced on September 27, 1983. GNU is a Unix-like operating system, the main differnce being that Unix is not free and GNU is. By the time of 1991 GNU had all the tools to be a indipendent os. But it was missing one core component which was extremly neccesary and that was the kerel. Luckly for GNU Linus Torvalds was working on a hobby project at the time that was the Linux kernel, it was originaly named Freax but the Admin of the Project changed the name to Linux.
