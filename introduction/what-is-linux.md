# Indtroduction to Linux

What is Linux: Linux is the kernel of the GNU operating system made by Richard Stallman and publicly announced on September 27, 1983. GNU is a Unix-like operating system, the main difference being that Unix is not free and GNU is. By the time of 1991 GNU had all the tools to be independent os. But it was missing one core component which was extremely necessary and that was the kernel. Luckily for GNU Linus Torvalds was working on a hobby project at the time that was the Linux kernel, it was originally named Freax but the Admin of the Project changed the name to Linux. Linux was first was not open source, but soon became and was released under the GNU GPL license. This gave birth to a new OS called GNU/Linux.
